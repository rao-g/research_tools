abstract = {The article conceptualizes character assassination (CA) as a tactic of populist communication on social media by using the case study of Italian politician Matteo Salvini. CA consists of personal attacks aimed at damaging the reputation of individuals, used as political means to attack the “enemies of the people.” By means of CA, populists operate a shift from issues and arguments toward individual traits and behaviors. CA's importance is linked to the features of social media communication (i.e. disintermediation, speed, virality, fragmentation, emotionality). The article uses content analysis of tweets, and qualitative analysis of relevant examples; it demonstrates the strategic nature of CA in Salvini's communication and identifies five functions (i.e. polarizing, personalizing, symbolic, discriminating, emotional) of CA in right-wing populist communication. CA's logic is unpacked, by showing how the delegitimization of individuals is used to reinforce a populist communication strategy. Potential implications and responses to CA are discussed.},

abstract = {This article focuses on the controlled communication that the main Italian political leaders – Silvio Berlusconi, Luigi Di Maio, Pietro Grasso, Giorgia Meloni, Matteo Renzi, Matteo Salvini – published on their Facebook profiles during a period of four weeks before election day. Taking the 2018 Italian general election campaign as an illustration, this article aims to clarify whether and to what extent populist communication on Facebook differs from non-populist communication in terms of volume and likes received. Facebook was selected as the source, since digital politics and social media are becoming increasingly relevant for both political parties and citizens. The article shows that, in general, messages containing populist claims get more ‘likes' compared to non-populist messages. However, only messages containing references to immigrants – namely complete and excluding populism – appear to be significantly correlated with the number of likes.},

abstract = {The investigation explores the representations of Italian populism and immigration on social media. Although social media are the preferred vehicle of populist communication, their role has only begun to be studied in recent years. We are part of this new attention by focusing on both communication and its impact on followers of two populist leaders, the politically transversal oriented Luigi Di Maio, and the far-right oriented Matteo Salvini. In line with the theory of social representations (SR), our starting point is that language is opaque and capable of promoting and directing inferences through specific linguistic markers that widely use the emotional register to make communication more effective. Our study focuses on how the populism and immigration issues are represented on Facebook by the two populist leaders. We chose to treat the two representations at the same time because of the strong connection that binds them. The posts of two leaders, general and immigration-focused, were compared for their language patterns, emotional characterization, and followers' approval. The language used and the topics covered highlighted the coexistence of different representations of populism, which coexist giving a clear signal of widespread forms of cognitive polyphasia. We noticed a greater use of the emotional register in Salvini, compared to Di Maio. In Salvini this register is more accentuated in the posts on immigration, characterized by a negative tone and with the highest rate of popularity among his followers, both compared to generalist posts and compared to Di Maio's posts. The results are discussed with respect to the literature on social representations and their impact at the societal level.},

abstract = {This article examines populist leaders' politicisation of food in their social media performances. More precisely, it analyses Matteo Salvini's Instagram posts during the 2019 European elections, and the way food is mobilized for populist and nationalist purposes. The main argument is that food serves as a cultural trope that confers identity, reinforcing social divisions and the terms of national and class belonging. Drawing on Bourdieu's (1984) social critique of taste, political leaders have traditionally placed themselves on the side of a distant gastronomic culture; that of a high-end elite. However, populist leaders perform a twofold role, attempting to present themselves as part of the common people and distancing themselves from the traditional elite. This change in social positioning is reflected in their social media accounts, often posting "authentic" glimpses of their cultural practices, such as cooking and eating. Methodologically, this paper uses a mixed-methods concurrent design, combining digital ethnography and visual rhetoric analysis for examining both the discursive and the aesthetic clues that construct Salvini's social positioning towards taste. Through food, being Italian becomes a matter of constructing Italian authenticity against the national intellectual and political elite, but also against the European value-building project.},

abstract = {Politicians are among the most affected by the breaking of live-stream services in social networks: this new communication has opened up uncharted ways to interact with supporters. Matteo Salvini, the most influential representative of European far-right populism, has developed one of the most effective social media communication strategies turning this feature in the key for his success. The rise of populism in the Western world has often been linked to social networks, considered to be favourable environments for its proliferation exploiting a subsoil made of fake-news, oversimplification of reality and memes. I don't want to suggest that the digital arena is inherently the root of all current evil. I will try instead to argue that the ability demonstrated by populist political communication is related to a coalescence of network inherent features, visual strategies and innovative approaches that lead to such efficacy. I conducted a limited quantitative analysis based on the Salvini's account activities in the 16 weeks following his official assignment to the Home Office. As shown in the bubble chart Salvini's posts are consisting almost entirely of videos and live-streams; even when photo, link or status are posted, videos still remain the most vivid contents collecting more likes and comments.},

abstract = {Purpose - this article aims to describe how leaders identified as populist frame the specific issue of the labour market and industrial relations on social media in Italy. Design/methodology/approach - two datasets of Instagram posts and tweets from Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini are provided. The field of labour and industrial relations include income support policies, welfare, and taxation. Data are interpreted from a rhetorical-framing perspective. Findings - Labour and industrial relations issues appear to be fully functional to pit "people" or "citizens" against political or economic elites. Representation of work issues by Italian populism falls short of novelty in terms of framing, even when regarding gig-workers and the platform economy. Research limitations/implications - The datasets of Instagram posts and tweets from Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini are limited to data from January the 1st to November the 13th. A rhetorical-framing analysis is conducted only on Instagram data. Originality/value - the paper argues that work should be taken into account as a fundamental dimension of citizenship, thus connecting political discourse and the representative democracy that builds on it. A specific theoretical framework is formulated integrating framing theory and new rhetoric. The framing theory recalled by George Lakoff is interpreted as a modern version of Aristotelian topics integrating emotional connotations.},
